Hi, my name is Patrick, and I have a lifelong passion for computers.

**`A Little About Me`**

I started disassembling computers around age 10, when I was able to acquire an old Mac computer my school was throwing out.  From there, I spent many nights, taking it apart, examining each component, and putting it back together, hoping it would work. I'd poke around the system settings, just marvelling at everything it could do. So for many years, I kept tinkering with any electronics I could get my hands on. At one point, I even ran a freelance computer repair service in a small town, undercutting the competition so I'd have the chance to learn more. <br /> <br />
Then one day, I started thinking about the internet. I wondered how it all came together to put the information (and a lot of videos over the years) on my screen, on demand.  Where did this data come from? How did it get to me through a small cable? How does it all work? <br /> <br />
So that was it. Along the way, I was given a few computer parts, to build my own server. And over time, I built more on it. Adding new hardware, tweaking the software to match what I wanted, and eventually, I was online and managing my own server!
Even now, I'm over the moon about how it all fits together. I even had the opportunity to build state-of-the-art servers for a massive AI! <br /> <br />
If you want to see a bit of a preview of what I've made on my own little server, check out the links to both a lovely 90's style weather page (that will accurately forecast the weather in your area), and a site where you can chat with the ollama LLM. I even pushed my ollama LLM to a Discord bot, so you can have a question answered while in a chat with your friends!
Thank you for reading this, and I hope you join me as I continue my journey through networking!
